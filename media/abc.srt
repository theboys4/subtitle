It's not that I don't want
to marry, it's just...

You want to be sultan. But why?

510
00:26:29,286 --> 00:26:30,989
You remember my

we would only ever be as happy
as our least happy subject?

you own everything.

did find your bracelet.

01:21:14,435 --> 01:21:15,170
pretending to be a thief
to see the city...

1619

but he's actually a prince.

1620
01:21:18,005 --> 01:21:19,407
I convinced her that I
really was a prince.

And you believed him?

1622

And she believed you?

1623
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:23,011
I think so.

1624
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:27,315
Eventually, you are going to
have to tell her the truth.

Eventually, I will tell her.

am a prince now.

drink from that cup.

You don't think maybe you
want to believe him...

01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:43,498
because you have
to marry a prince,

but you can't marry a thief?

1632

No, I believe him. I do.
